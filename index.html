                               This time I was on tour and decided to opt private stay homes for stay, that too for the first time. The last-minute planning went fuzzy and I decided to seek Sangeetha and her husband’s help in finalising the stay, which was at a walkable distance from the place I have to visit.

</p>  <p> Thanks for them for dropping me and especially to Pradeek for conforming all security aspects of the place. </p>  <p> 

Once the check in procedures were completed, I decided to explore the place a little more to find out local amenities.</p>  <p> 
I came out of the building, and as usual, the first thing I tried was to trace out the map.
The location of the home was propely tagged, but the map is not updating properly as I advance. 
I couldn’t make out the directions from the way it shows. Moving forward and backward couldn’t help. 
I tired with phone twisting, shaking and the only action left way throwing away. 
Now I could realise it is not going to be an easy task when the darkness already covered the landmarks, an requires a basic idea about the locality.
</p>  <p> 
That triggered the alert of getting dependence, which I preferred least. From my previous experience with this place I know these n crosses are going to confuse me, and push me into trouble as always.  I decided to move along one side of the road and keep counting the crosses to trace back to the stay location. I could have chosen building as landmark, but the building and the malls looks hauted once the lights are office and no one can realise. i dont want to repeat the chennai episode, so this time only crosses as nodes for tracebility, the place is well known for proper displays at the crosses, eventhough i have not trained enough for this pattern.
</p>  <p> 
Many renovations and construction and mostly I could find were the construction workers.
</p>  <p> 
I was fascinated at observing people and nature and I continued the same while walking through the streets and crossing the crosses. Now I got a rough idea about the locality and decided to walk back.
</p>  <p> 
Seeing so many other state workers, remind me about the events at Hyderabad, Bangalore.. and also about the article about the psycho nature and reasons for such stages.
</p>  <p> 
Reaching near the homes I was so alerted about the security aspects and I started inspecting, the wall highest is not enough, someone who climbs the wall can reach the room, the window……. I got a slight relief seeing the window faces the main road, so can expect a little more secure.
</p>  <p> 
Now the time was near to 10PM and I reaching the room I could find out the room service was not proper and they have not provided the water bottles. I called them and requested for the same.
</p>  <p> 
Meanwhile, I called my siblings and decided to check the FB. Opening the page itself it showed “Taking lives” with a brief “hunting down a serial killer who assumes the identities of his victims after killing them.” serial killer ..psychopath, shouldn’t have opened Facebook. I started cursing the time I decided to log in to Facebook.
</p>  <p> 
KRRRR…. the sound took away my breath. It was the room boy. came with the water. while thanking him, I just watched doesn’t he look like a psycho?
</p>  <p> 
I closed the door and tried to sleep, yes again it is going to be a sleepless night…..cursing and counting ….1…1.30,…2.45…….3,3.35…..4,05,420…….5,505,..5.45,5.55..6.10…8.20…
</p>  <p> 
Time to get ready….but a feeling so relieved even though I couldn’t sleep…
