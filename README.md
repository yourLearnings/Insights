# Just another sleepless night 
<h3> Yes a few months back, just another scary sleepless night. </h3>


   <body>

 <p> 
This time I was on tour and decided to opt private stay homes for stay, that too for the first time. 
The last-minute planning went fuzzy and I decided to share it to my friend at bangalore.  They could help me finalise,  
the stay, which was at a walkable distance from the place,  I planned to visit.
</p>  
  
<p> 
Once the check in procedures were completed, I decided to explore the place a little more to find out local amenities.</p>  
<p> 
I came out of the building, and as usual, the first thing I tried was to trace out the map.
The location of the home was propely tagged, but the reatl time update was not proper and landmarks where not sufficient.  
I couldn’t make out the directions from the way it shows. Moving forward and backward couldn’t help. 
I tired with phone twisting, shaking and the only action left way throwing away. Now I could realise it is not going to be an easy 
task. The darkness already covered the landmarks, a familiar person can only trace back. 
</p>  
<p> 

   That triggered the alert of getting dependence, which I preferred least. 
From my previous experience with this place I know these n crosses are going to confuse me, and push me into trouble as always.  
I decided to move along one side of the road and keep counting the crosses to trace back to the stay location. 
I could have chosen building as landmark, but the building and the malls looks hauted once the lights are off and no one can realise. 

   I dont want to repeat the chennai episode, keeping building as reference for locality. 
   
   So this time only crosses as nodes for tracebility, the place is well known for proper displays at the crosses, 
eventhough I have not trained enough for this pattern. I started taking snaps for reference as i crossed each.
</p>  
<p> 
   So many renovations and construction work was taking place and a good percentage of the crowd were the construction workers.
</p>  
<p> 
   I was fascinated at observing the nature and people. I continued the same while walking through the streets and crossing the crosses.
Now I got a rough idea about the locality and decided to walk back.
</p>  
                                <p> 
Seeing so many other state workers, remind me about the events at Hyderabad, Bangalore.. and also about the article about the psycho nature and reasons for such stages. Unknowingly a fear was triggered in my mind. 
</p>  
                                <p> 
Reaching near the homes I was so alerted about the security aspects and I started inspecting, the wall highest is not enough, 
                                someone who climbs the wall can reach the room, the window……. 
                                I got a slight relief seeing the window faces the main road, so can expect a little more secure.
</p>  
                                <p> 
Now the time was near to 10PM and I reaching the room I could find out the room service was not proper and they have not provided the water bottles. 
                                I called them and requested for the same.
</p>  
                                <p> 
Meanwhile, I called my siblings and decided to check the FB. Opening the page itself it showed “Taking lives” with a brief “hunting down a serial killer who assumes the identities of his victims after killing them. 
   ” serial killer ..psychopath, I shouldn’t have opened Facebook. I started cursing the time I decided to log in to Facebook.
   I too have watched some, but made sure not during travel, or when staying alone. 
</p>  
                                <p> 
KRRRIIINNNGG….the door bell, the sound took away my breath. It was the room boy. came with the water bottles. 
                                while thanking him, I just watched doesn’t he look like a psycho?
</p>  
                                <p> 
I closed the door and tried to sleep, yes again it is going to be another sleepless
                                night…..cursing and counting ….1…1.30,…2.45…….3,3.35…..4,05,420…….5,505,..5.45,5.55..6.10…8.20…
</p>  
Time to get ready….but a feeling so relieved even though I couldn’t sleep peacefully a bit …
