# Just another sleepless night 


## Yes a few months back, just another scary sleepless night.
 This time I was on tour and decided to opt for private stay homes, that too for the first time. The last-minute planning went fuzzy, I decided to share the stay arrangements with my friend in Bangalore. They could help me finalise, the stay, which was at a walkable distance from the place, I planned to visit.
 
Once the check-in procedures were completed, I decided to explore the place a little more to find out local amenities.
I came out of the building, and the first thing I tried was to trace out the map, the most accurate, Trustable Guide and route tracker GOOGLE MAP.

But this time, homestay location was properly tagged, but the real-time update was not proper and landmarks were not sufficient. I couldn’t make out the directions from the way it shows. Moving forward and backwards couldn’t help. I tired with phone twisting, shaking and the only action left was throwing away. Now I could realise it is not going to be an easy task. The darkness already covered the landmarks, a familiar person can only traceback.
That triggered the alert of getting dependence, which I preferred least. From all my previous experience in Bangalore, I know these N crosses are going to confuse me and push me into trouble as always.
I decided to move along one side of the road and keep counting the crosses so that I can reach back. I could have chosen building as a landmark, but the building and the malls look haunted once the lights are off and no one can recognise.
I don’t want to repeat the Chennai episode, keeping the building as reference for the locality. The unique beauty of most of the buildings/malls are created with lights. Once they are off we realise the need for observing finer details.
This time the unique feature for recognition is Cross Landmarks, learnings from previous experiences must be adapted so that you won’t repeat the same mistakes. Building names were noted as an additional feature. The place is well known for proper displays at the crosses, even though I have not trained enough for this pattern. As an additional backup, I started taking snaps for reference as I crossed each.
So many renovations and construction work were taking place and a good percentage of the crowd were the construction workers.
I was fascinated at observing nature and people. I continued the same while walking through the streets and crossing the crosses. After an hour walk, I got a rough idea about the locality and decided to walk back.
Seeing so many other state workers, remind me about the events at Hyderabad, Bangalore.. and also about the article about the psycho nature and reasons for such stages. Unknowingly a fear crept into my mind. Even if I tried to be calm, so scenes were flashing in the background, triggering fear in my mind.
Reaching near the homes I was so alerted about the security aspects and I started inspecting, the wall highest is not enough, someone who climbs the wall can reach the room, the window……. I got a slight relief, seeing that my rooms, windows are facing the main road, so can ensure or expect a little more secure.
By 9.30 PM, I reached back. I called room service to enquire about morning services and requested for providing water bottles. Maam Currently they are slightly busy, the room boy will bring it before 10, came the reply.
Meanwhile, I decided to check Facebook.
Opening the page itself it showed “Taking lives” with a brief “hunting down a serial killer who assumes the identities of his victims after killing them. ” serial killer ..psychopath,
I shouldn’t have opened Facebook. The only face that comes to mind when I hear serial killer is from the scream, a man with a knife.
I started cursing the time I decided to log in to Facebook. I too have watched some, but made sure not during travel, or when staying alone.
KRRRIIINNNGG….the doorbell, the sound took away my breath. It was the room boy. came with the water bottles. while thanking him, I just watched doesn’t he look like a psycho?
I closed the door and tried to sleep, yes again it is going to be another sleepless night…..cursing and counting ….1…1.30,…2.45…….3,3.35…..4,05,420…….5,505,..5.45,5.55..6.10… 8.20…
Time to get ready….but a feeling so relieved even though I couldn’t sleep peacefully a bit …
